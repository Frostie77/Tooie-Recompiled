# Engineering handoff

Updated: 23 October 2026.

Start with the [completion checklist](../android-completion-requirements.md),
[build instructions](../../BUILDING.md) and [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).
Use the current repository refs and workflow profile for exact source identities.

## Accepted work

Odin evidence covers startup, selected gameplay routes, the previously failing
first-person entrance and a reported boss fight. The executable example's
GOLD/BLUE, configuration, restart/update persistence and disabled phases passed.
BT Reloaded UI import and Aiming Invert also passed their scoped checks.

The initial texture/aiming session is captured; the later Off/On comparisons
and restart persistence were manually accepted without a new capture.
[PR #14](https://github.com/Frostie77/Tooie-Recompiled/pull/14) retains that
distinction and exact artifact identities. Neither result is a full playthrough.

## Current priorities

Prepare the first Android preview: resolve distribution terms and release
signing/versioning, verify the intended update path preserves user data,
then package an identified candidate and release notes. Startup update detection,
multi-mod combinations and broader gameplay/lifecycle coverage remain open.

See [release preparation](release.md) for restored font notices, upstream's
RecompFrontend GPL grant, explicit Android version inputs and the read-only
candidate verifier. The approved Comic Neue Bold menu font and its original OFL
replace the old font in both asset trees. The remaining asset/dependency
inventory and release-key migration remain open. CI signing fixtures
are temporary test identities, not release credentials.

Known minor graphics details and intro/demo cadence/stutter remain tracked.
The old first-person failure is resolved on the tested route; historical crash
work orders must not be treated as the current status.

## Preserve

- Android ARM64 scope, package `io.github.banjotooierecompiled`, existing ROM,
  saves, settings and installed mods.
- The **Tooie Recompiled** display name, selected round BT/Jiggy icon and
  approved red **TOOIE-** / blue **-RECOMPILED** launcher artwork.
- Vulkan guards, descriptor/ownership checks, synchronization and five-second
  timeouts. Normal production uses allocation probe Off, queue isolation `0`,
  and undefined transfer/fallback/barrier diagnostic selectors.
- Actual-consumer regressions and meaningful exact-parent/failure controls.
  Host compilation, software Vulkan and device gameplay are separate evidence.
- One-terminal captures, numbered notes and one compact Share ZIP. Keep graphics
  fixed during comparisons and retain raw evidence locally. Separately recorded
  replacement install/launch sessions are allowed; resolve unknown outcomes
  before retries. Preserve app data.

A Remove Mod button is not required. Public GitHub prose identifies the owner
as **Frostie**. Follow the [technical guides and history](README.md) for the
relevant subsystem rather than reusing an old investigation's pending-work list.
